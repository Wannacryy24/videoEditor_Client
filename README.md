⚡ Flow in simple terms:

User uploads video → goes to Supabase storage.

Metadata (filename, size, owner, status) saved in Supabase DB.

Node.js backend picks the file, runs FFmpeg commands → processes video.

Processed video saved back to Supabase storage.

Frontend fetches video & history from Supabase DB → shows to user.





Frontend (User Interface)

React.js → Build interactive UI.

Context API (or Redux later if needed) → Manage app-wide state (e.g., selected video, user session).

Tailwind CSS → Modern styling, responsive design.

Backend (Video Processing & API)

Node.js + Express.js → Create backend APIs, handle requests.

FFmpeg (installed on your server) → Perform real video editing: cut, trim, merge, compress, extract audio, add subtitles, etc.

Database & Storage

Supabase (Free Plan gives auth + Postgres + storage):

Auth → Login/signup, social logins (Google, GitHub).

Database (Postgres) → Store video metadata, user history, project saves.

Storage → Save uploaded videos and final edited outputs.

✅ Advantages of this stack:

100% free to start.

Easy integration (Supabase gives backend + DB + storage in one).

Scalable → Later you can switch to AWS/GCP if needed.

Node.js + FFmpeg = powerful backend, production ready.







<!-- Better approach for your project:

Use local/in-memory history for undo/redo (just store the timeline edits: start time, end time, filters, etc.).

Only save the final exported video (or major checkpoints) in Supabase Storage. -->




const history = [
  {
    step: 0,
    type: "checkpoint",
    file: "original.mp4" // initial import
  },
  {
    step: 1,
    type: "operation",
    action: "trim",
    params: { start: 0, end: 10 }
  },
  {
    step: 2,
    type: "operation",
    action: "addText",
    params: { text: "Intro", position: "top-left" }
  },
  ...
  {
    step: 8,
    type: "checkpoint",
    file: "checkpoint8.mp4" // save video state here
  },
  {
    step: 9,
    type: "operation",
    action: "addFilter",
    params: { filter: "grayscale" }
  },
  ...
  {
    step: 16,
    type: "checkpoint",
    file: "checkpoint16.mp4"
  },
];
